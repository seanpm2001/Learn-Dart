### Learning Dart (programming language)

I know very little about the Dart programming language. I don't intend to go far with this language. This document will go over all of my knowledge of the Dart programming language.

#### Hello World in Dart

This is how you make a Hello World program in Dart:

```dart
void main() {
  print('Hello, World!');
}
```

#### Comments in Dart

Comments in Dart are the same as in PHP.

##### Single line comments

Single line comments in Dart are written like so:

```dart
// This is a single line comment
```

##### Multi-line comments

Multi-line comments in Dart are written like so:

```dart
/* This is a
* multi-line
* comment */
/* This is 
also a
multi-line
comment
*/
```

#### Break keyword in Dart

```dart
break;
```

To this day, I am still not entirely sure what the `break` keyword does, but most languages support it.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Classes in Dart

Dart supports classes. They can be implemented like so:

```dart
class myDartClass {
    print("Welcome to Dart class");
    break;
}
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Other knowledge of the Dart programming language

1. Dart is a language by Google

2. Dart is a semicolon and curly bracket language

3. Dart uses the `*.dart` file extension by default

4. Dart is a functional programming language

5. Dart is heavily influenced by C in syntax

6. Dart transpiles to JavaScript, similarly to languages like TypeScript

7. Dart is one of the top 50 programming languages (as of 2022, July 31st, ranking #32)

8. Dart was first created in the year 2011

9. No other knowledge of the Dart programming language

#### Additional comments

1. I have no intentions to use this language seriously

2. No other additional comments available
